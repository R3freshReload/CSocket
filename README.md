# CSocket
This is a small project that wraps the standard C Socket to an object oriented version. 
Not all C-Socket features are implemented.

I have only tested this with MINGW-w64.

# How to use:
Just include the Socket.h in your project, add ´-lwsock32´ and ´-lws2_32´ to your ´gcc´ command and you should be good to go.
